Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect the way people communicate, interact, and behave. ASD is often diagnosed by observing certain behavioural symptoms, such as hand/arm flapping, which is a form of self-stimulatory behaviour (stimming). Stimming refers to repetitive movements or sounds that individuals with ASD make to regulate their sensory input, express emotions, or cope with stress. Hand/arm flapping can vary in frequency, intensity, duration, and pattern, depending on the individual and the context.

In this deep learning project, it aims to explore the possibility of classifying different hand/arm flapping characteristics using the Self-Stimulatory Behaviours in the Wild for Autism Diagnosis Dataset (SSBD). The SSBD dataset contains 35 videos of children with ASD exhibiting hand/arm flapping in natural settings. From that dataset, we decided to classify only two flipping characteristics: moving arms and shaking both hands. This is because these two flipping characteristics are the most common and distinctive among the videos in the SSBD dataset.
